This section of the Chaste wiki contains pages generated automatically from the source code accompanying
"[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2013.05.235 Connecting models to data in multiscale multicellular tissue simulations]",
our paper in the [http://www.iccs-meeting.org/iccs2013 2013 International Conference on Computational Science].
(A [attachment:paper627.pdf pre-print] is attached to this wiki page, but the published paper is open access.)

The paper describes a 'proof of concept' parameter sweep simulation performed using our [wiki:FunctionalCuration Functional Curation]
tools on a model implemented in [http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste/cell_based_index.html cell-based Chaste].
The code which achieves this, and enables reproduction of all the figures in the paper, is shown in [./CryptProliferation this sub-page].

Before running this simulation you will need to [wiki:InstallGuides/InstallGuide install Chaste's dependencies].
The easiest way to do this is using an Ubuntu machine (or an Ubuntu virtual machine) as discussed on InstallGuides/UbuntuPackage.
Note that while Chaste 3.2 has support for cell-based Chaste on Windows and Mac OS X, the code for this paper ''does not work''
on Windows, and has not been tested on Mac OS X, so the virtual machine route may be advisable in these instances.
In order to generate result figures automatically, you will also need to install [http://www.gnuplot.info/ Gnuplot].

You will also need the Chaste source code for this paper and the source for the extension FunctionalCuration project.
These are available from the [http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste/download.html main Chaste download page] as extensions to
Chaste release 3.2 under the projects heading,
or you can [wiki:ChasteGuides/AccessCodeRepository access the source code direct from our repository].
For the latter option, using a command-line subversion client, you can get the required code in a new folder called 'Chaste' with the commands:
{{{
#!sh
svn --username anonymous checkout https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/svn/chaste/tags/release_3.2 Chaste
cd Chaste/projects
svn --username anonymous checkout https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/svn/chaste/tags/FunctionalCuration_release_3.2 FunctionalCuration
svn --username anonymous checkout https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/svn/chaste/tags/Wisc2013_release_3.2 Wisc2013
}}}
Use your email address as the password for the 'anonymous' account.

'''NB''': Note that the code for this paper ''will not work'' with Chaste release 3.1 or earlier.
It has been tested with release 3.3, but will not be tested with future versions.

You are now ready to [./CryptProliferation run the simulations featured in the paper].

For further information on using Chaste, see our [wiki:ChasteGuides extensive guide material].
You may also wish to look at some of the [wiki:UserTutorials basic user tutorials].
