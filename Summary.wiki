"Connecting models to data in multiscale multicellular tissue simulations", our paper under submission to
the [http://www.iccs-meeting.org/iccs2013/workshop-list.php#ws6 2013 Workshop on Interoperability in Scientific Computing],
a satellite of [http://www.iccs-meeting.org/iccs2013/ ICCS2013].

The paper describes a 'proof of concept' parameter sweep simulation performed using our [wiki:FunctionalCuration Functional Curation]
tools on a model implemented in http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste/cell_based_index.html cell-based Chaste].
The code which achieves this, and enables reproduction of all the figures in the paper, is shown in [./CryptProliferation this sub-page].

Before running this simulation you will need to [wiki:InstallGuides/InstallGuide install Chaste's dependencies].
The easiest way to do this is using an Ubuntu machine (or an Ubuntu virtual machine) as discussed on InstallGuides/UbuntuPackage.
Note that Chaste is only supported on Linux/Unix systems, so users of Windows or Mac OS X will need to follow the virtual machine route.
For manual installation of each dependency, on any version of Linux, see DeveloperInstallGuide.
In order to generate result figures automatically, you will also need to install [http://www.gnuplot.info/ Gnuplot].

You will also need the Chaste source code and the source for the extension FunctionalCuration project.
When version 3.2 is released the code for this paper will be updated to work with it, and made available on the
[http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste/download.html main download page].
Until then we recommend [wiki:ChasteGuides/AccessCodeRepository accessing the source code from our repository],
using [source:trunk?rev=17910 revision 17910].  Using a command-line subversion client, you can get the required
code in a new folder called 'Chaste' with the commands:
{{{
#!sh
svn --username anonymous checkout -r17910 https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/svn/chaste/trunk/ Chaste
cd Chaste/projects
svn --username anonymous checkout -r17910 https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/svn/chaste/projects/FunctionalCuration
svn --username reviewer checkout -r17910 https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/svn/chaste/projects/Wisc2013
}}}
Use your email address as the password for the 'anonymous' account.

'''NB''': Note that the code for this paper ''will not work'' with Chaste release 3.1 or earlier.

You are now ready to [./CryptProliferation run the simulations featured in the paper].

For further information on using Chaste, see our [wiki:ChasteGuides extensive guide material].
You may also wish to look at some of the [wiki:UserTutorials basic user tutorials].
